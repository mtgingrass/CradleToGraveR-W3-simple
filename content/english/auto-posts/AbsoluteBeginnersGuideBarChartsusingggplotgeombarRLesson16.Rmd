previously we played around with some G on point or scatterplots
today I'm gonna show you how to create some bar plots and so follow along add
library ggplot and we're going to create our own data frame as well which we
haven't had a lot of practice with so we
can create a data frame we will assign a data frame structure so to get that
structure we include data frame as a function the function data frame will
return a data frame structure so a data frame we're going to input random data
so I'm going to put people and we're going to set people equal to and
remember the c is like reminds me of column so if i have a column of people
the header is called people and the people that are in that column is
whatever we want them to be let's do Dave Jackie

<iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ac&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=hatro-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=1491910399&asins=1491910399&linkId=9a117bbbc925d59dc8b7f7c2b1fad2ad&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true&price_color=333333&title_color=0066c0&bg_color=ffffff">

00:01
mark and then we'll do for an example we're gonna repeat a couple of these
let's do mark mark a couple times and let's add a another one Jill okay so we
have some people here now this data frame only consists of one column at the
moment so let's create another column let's add something by hitting a comma
here I'm gonna hit enter just to get some white space in there I want to add
their ages so we'll do the same thing we'll use a column let's put that C
there and let's put in ages twenty three
twenty five I'm just making these up and I think there should be at least six of
them right and they don't have to be in any order something like that so there
are some ages for us and let's add one more and put gender in there so a column
that says gender we're gonna do male female male male

00:02
male and finally female let's hit command to enter on that and make sure
your data frame your DF the object returned is a data frame you can see it
over here and in our environment click on DF you can see what I'm talking about
the columns of people columns of Ages and gender and they're all lined up it's
a little confusing sometimes because you're kind of looking at it
horizontally here and then when it actually displays in the GUI interface
or the view it goes downward so let's let's keep that in mind ok now we're
ready to create some bar plots let me show you the basic way to do it we're
gonna create our base plot we're gonna call that our I don't know DF base we're
going to assign this to DF base a GG plot remember and then we add the data
equals data is equal to our data frame that we just created above that comma
our aesthetic let's say we want to plot our x equals let's just go ahead and say

00:03
people across the x-axis and let's let's hit command enter on that you'll see
there's no error but it also doesn't plot anything even if I did DF base here
and I hit command enter it plots remember it just set up our plots but it
didn't actually plot anything because there's no us there's no geometry to
this so let's go ahead and add a geometry let's do a DF base and we're
going to add a geometry geometry gonna do G on bar now inside of this bar there
is a parameter you have to set and that is the statistic we want a statistic to
be equal to something if we put in the statistic to equal count let's let's see
what happens so we are gonna we are going to plot
this right now in real time on line 9 by hitting command enter and what you see
here on the bottom is you see our names Dave Jacky Jill and mark but you see
mark has a count of 3 on the top left here as you can see I am in there 3

00:04
times so that makes perfect sense but what if we wanted to plot instead of the
occurrences of my name but we wanted to plot some of the values like let's plot
our ages that correspond with our names which is a little bit different here so
instead of our x equals people which it will we're also going to
add an aesthetic 4y is equal to age and let's see what we get here so we're
going to do command enter to refresh our DF base and when add to that base our
geometry now let's see what happens here
we probably will get an error so it says down here that the stat count must not
be used with a Y aesthetic so we can't do a count here but what we do is we put
in identity and once we do that we hit enter we have our identity it just means
hey use this age as the value on our y-axis so we have our ages across the
y-axis however as you can tell here since my name was repeated three times

00:05
it actually added up our ages so it a grenaded them so typically let's just
get rid of the other marks typically you
would use this so we'll delete two males
and let's rerun this again and it should make more sense did I get in here oh we
didn't get rid of the yeah just get rid of to two ages as well run that again
and here we go so now the ages are there so 60 Jill is 60 you see it here it
lines up so the difference between identity and count is very important one
more thing here we want to also know which one's male and which ones female
that would be kind of fun to have let's see if we can add anything to that so we
have a geometry of stat equals identity comma AES fill equals and we're gonna
put the fill as our gender let's see what happens there
and these are fun to play around with so you can tell that the female is the red

00:06
and the male is the green and it did exactly what we were saying lots of
different options on here you have to also learn how to use the help features
within our itself by doing question mark you can type in things like G on
went or G on bar and you can read the help down here if that doesn't quite do
it for you when you go to you stack over or something in google you google it
you're gonna see things that are similar and just getting used to the syntax is
really what matters because you know this could have easily have been let's
let's see what happens if we put this in our actual geometry plot up here as an
aesthetic and we say fill equals gender rerun that and run it and it does the
same thing so when you see things that are slightly different don't be afraid
to try them out as all I'm saying but yeah now we have a colorful pretty chart

00:07
and that's the basics of bar charts so when you use identity you're actually
using the y-axis as some sort of value in your data in this case our age and
when we're using stat we're doing a count of how many occurrences for
example let's do one more example and let's let's go and say let's make this
60 into a 23 so we should have if we do the stat equals count again but with the
count remember we can't have in a y-axis because we're just doing a count of
occurrences and we're not doing people we're doing age now let's keep the fill
as gender there and just see what happens so we hit enter gender not found
let's see there we go something just wasn't loaded
and now we run this again and we do have the gender works now of course this

00:08
doesn't make too much sense because we have our ages as a continuous variable
when we know it's discrete so what we could do is what we have to do is we can
say factor age and do it this way because remember it all depends on what
you're doing but if we do it as factor it actually stacks them up like that
again factors are like categories instead of saying hey we have a
continuous amount of ages which we really we do but not in this data you
know we have a very specific age 23 doesn't matter if you 23 and a half or
23.2 so remember that if you run into that problem where this is gone and it
like this you know you're looking at a continuous spectrum between zero and
whatever that highest number is you probably want this to be a factor or a
category I want to know how categorically how many people are age 23
that's male and how many that are female and that's what this chart shows you

00:09
simple and there are so many things you can do with ggplot I just wanted to give
you a very quick explanation of how bar charts work so there you go let's move
on to the next lessonEnd of file

00:01
mark and then we'll do for an example we're gonna repeat a couple of these
let's do mark mark a couple times and let's add a another one Jill okay so we
have some people here now this data frame only consists of one column at the

ready to create some bar plots let me show you the basic way to do it we're
gonna create our base plot we're gonna call that our I don't know DF base we're
going to assign this to DF base a GG plot remember and then we add the data
equals data is equal to our data frame that we just created above that comma
our aesthetic let's say we want to plot our x equals let's just go ahead and say

00:03
people across the x-axis and let's let's hit command enter on that you'll see
there's no error but it also doesn't plot anything even if I did DF base here
and I hit command enter it plots remember it just set up our plots but it
didn't actually plot anything because there's no us there's no geometry to
this so let's go ahead and add a geometry let's do a DF base and we're
going to add a geometry geometry gonna do G on bar now inside of this bar there
is a parameter you have to set and that is the statistic we want a statistic to
be equal to something if we put in the statistic to equal count let's let's see
what happens so we are gonna we are going to plot
this right now in real time on line 9 by hitting command enter and what you see
here on the bottom is you see our names Dave Jacky Jill and mark but you see
mark has a count of 3 on the top left here as you can see I am in there 3

00:04
times so that makes perfect sense but what if we wanted to plot instead of the
occurrences of my name but we wanted to plot some of the values like let's plot
our ages that correspond with our names which is a little bit different here so
instead of our x equals people which it will we're also going to
add an aesthetic 4y is equal to age and let's see what we get here so we're
going to do command enter to refresh our DF base and when add to that base our
geometry now let's see what happens here
we probably will get an error so it says down here that the stat count must not
be used with a Y aesthetic so we can't do a count here but what we do is we put
in identity and once we do that we hit enter we have our identity it just means
hey use this age as the value on our y-axis so we have our ages across the
y-axis however as you can tell here since my name was repeated three times

00:05
it actually added up our ages so it a grenaded them so typically let's just
get rid of the other marks typically you
would use this so we'll delete two males
and let's rerun this again and it should make more sense did I get in here oh we
didn't get rid of the yeah just get rid of to two ages as well run that again
and here we go so now the ages are there so 60 Jill is 60 you see it here it
lines up so the difference between identity and count is very important one
more thing here we want to also know which one's male and which ones female
that would be kind of fun to have let's see if we can add anything to that so we
have a geometry of stat equals identity comma AES fill equals and we're gonna
put the fill as our gender let's see what happens there
and these are fun to play around with so you can tell that the female is the red

00:06
and the male is the green and it did exactly what we were saying lots of
different options on here you have to also learn how to use the help features
within our itself by doing question mark you can type in things like G on
went or G on bar and you can read the help down here if that doesn't quite do
it for you when you go to you stack over or something in google you google it
you're gonna see things that are similar and just getting used to the syntax is
really what matters because you know this could have easily have been let's
let's see what happens if we put this in our actual geometry plot up here as an
aesthetic and we say fill equals gender rerun that and run it and it does the
same thing so when you see things that are slightly different don't be afraid
to try them out as all I'm saying but yeah now we have a colorful pretty chart

00:07
and that's the basics of bar charts so when you use identity you're actually
using the y-axis as some sort of value in your data in this case our age and
when we're using stat we're doing a count of how many occurrences for
example let's do one more example and let's let's go and say let's make this
60 into a 23 so we should have if we do the stat equals count again but with the
count remember we can't have in a y-axis because we're just doing a count of
occurrences and we're not doing people we're doing age now let's keep the fill
as gender there and just see what happens so we hit enter gender not found
let's see there we go something just wasn't loaded
and now we run this again and we do have the gender works now of course this

00:08
doesn't make too much sense because we have our ages as a continuous variable
when we know it's discrete so what we could do is what we have to do is we can
say factor age and do it this way because remember it all depends on what
you're doing but if we do it as factor it actually stacks them up like that
again factors are like categories instead of saying hey we have a
continuous amount of ages which we really we do but not in this data you
know we have a very specific age 23 doesn't matter if you 23 and a half or
23.2 so remember that if you run into that problem where this is gone and it
like this you know you're looking at a continuous spectrum between zero and
whatever that highest number is you probably want this to be a factor or a
category I want to know how categorically how many people are age 23
that's male and how many that are female and that's what this chart shows you

00:09
simple and there are so many things you can do with ggplot I just wanted to give
you a very quick explanation of how bar charts work so there you go let's move

previously we played around with some G on point or scatterplots
today I'm gonna show you how to create some bar plots and so follow along add
library ggplot and we're going to create our own data frame as well which we
haven't had a lot of practice with so we
can create a data frame we will assign a data frame structure so to get that
structure we include data frame as a function the function data frame will
return a data frame structure so a data frame we're going to input random data
so I'm going to put people and we're going to set people equal to and
remember the c is like reminds me of column so if i have a column of people
the header is called people and the people that are in that column is
whatever we want them to be let's do Dave Jackie

00:01
mark and then we'll do for an example we're gonna repeat a couple of these
let's do mark mark a couple times and let's add a another one Jill okay so we
have some people here now this data frame only consists of one column at the
moment so let's create another column let's add something by hitting a comma
here I'm gonna hit enter just to get some white space in there I want to add
their ages so we'll do the same thing we'll use a column let's put that C
there and let's put in ages twenty three
twenty five I'm just making these up and I think there should be at least six of
them right and they don't have to be in any order something like that so there
are some ages for us and let's add one more and put gender in there so a column
that says gender we're gonna do male female male male

00:02
male and finally female let's hit command to enter on that and make sure
your data frame your DF the object returned is a data frame you can see it
over here and in our environment click on DF you can see what I'm talking about
the columns of people columns of Ages and gender and they're all lined up it's
a little confusing sometimes because you're kind of looking at it
horizontally here and then when it actually displays in the GUI interface
or the view it goes downward so let's let's keep that in mind ok now we're
ready to create some bar plots let me show you the basic way to do it we're
gonna create our base plot we're gonna call that our I don't know DF base we're
going to assign this to DF base a GG plot remember and then we add the data
equals data is equal to our data frame that we just created above that comma
our aesthetic let's say we want to plot our x equals let's just go ahead and say

00:03
people across the x-axis and let's let's hit command enter on that you'll see
there's no error but it also doesn't plot anything even if I did DF base here
and I hit command enter it plots remember it just set up our plots but it
didn't actually plot anything because there's no us there's no geometry to
this so let's go ahead and add a geometry let's do a DF base and we're
going to add a geometry geometry gonna do G on bar now inside of this bar there
is a parameter you have to set and that is the statistic we want a statistic to
be equal to something if we put in the statistic to equal count let's let's see
what happens so we are gonna we are going to plot
this right now in real time on line 9 by hitting command enter and what you see
here on the bottom is you see our names Dave Jacky Jill and mark but you see
mark has a count of 3 on the top left here as you can see I am in there 3

00:04

occurrences of my name but we wanted to plot some of the values like let's plot

previously we played around with some G on point or scatterplots
today I'm gonna show you how to create some bar plots and so follow along add
library ggplot and we're going to create our own data frame as well which we
haven't had a lot of practice with so we
can create a data frame we will assign a data frame structure so to get that
structure we include data frame as a function the function data frame will
return a data frame structure so a data frame we're going to input random data
so I'm going to put people and we're going to set people equal to and
remember the c is like reminds me of column so if i have a column of people
the header is called people and the people that are in that column is
whatever we want them to be let's do Dave Jackie

00:01
mark and then we'll do for an example we're gonna repeat a couple of these
let's do mark mark a couple times and let's add a another one Jill okay so we
have some people here now this data frame only consists of one column at the
moment so let's create another column let's add something by hitting a comma
here I'm gonna hit enter just to get some white space in there I want to add
their ages so we'll do the same thing we'll use a column let's put that C
there and let's put in ages twenty three
twenty five I'm just making these up and I think there should be at least six of
them right and they don't have to be in any order something like that so there
are some ages for us and let's add one more and put gender in there so a column
that says gender we're gonna do male female male male

00:02
male and finally female let's hit command to enter on that and make sure
your data frame your DF the object returned is a data frame you can see it
over here and in our environment click on DF you can see what I'm talking about
the columns of people columns of Ages and gender and they're all lined up it's
a little confusing sometimes because you're kind of looking at it
horizontally here and then when it actually displays in the GUI interface
or the view it goes downward so let's let's keep that in mind ok now we're
ready to create some bar plots let me show you the basic way to do it we're
gonna create our base plot we're gonna call that our I don't know DF base we're
going to assign this to DF base a GG plot remember and then we add the data
equals data is equal to our data frame that we just created above that comma
our aesthetic let's say we want to plot our x equals let's just go ahead and say

00:03
people across the x-axis and let's let's hit command enter on that you'll see
there's no error but it also doesn't plot anything even if I did DF base here
and I hit command enter it plots remember it just set up our plots but it
didn't actually plot anything because there's no us there's no geometry to
this so let's go ahead and add a geometry let's do a DF base and we're
going to add a geometry geometry gonna do G on bar now inside of this bar there
is a parameter you have to set and that is the statistic we want a statistic to
be equal to something if we put in the statistic to equal count let's let's see
what happens so we are gonna we are going to plot
this right now in real time on line 9 by hitting command enter and what you see
here on the bottom is you see our names Dave Jacky Jill and mark but you see
mark has a count of 3 on the top left here as you can see I am in there 3

00:04
times so that makes perfect sense but what if we wanted to plot instead of the
occurrences of my name but we wanted to plot some of the values like let's plot
our ages that correspond with our names which is a little bit different here so
instead of our x equals people which it will we're also going to
add an aesthetic 4y is equal to age and let's see what we get here so we're
going to do command enter to refresh our DF base and when add to that base our
geometry now let's see what happens here
we probably will get an error so it says down here that the stat count must not
be used with a Y aesthetic so we can't do a count here but what we do is we put
in identity and once we do that we hit enter we have our identity it just means
hey use this age as the value on our y-axis so we have our ages across the
y-axis however as you can tell here since my name was repeated three times

00:05
it actually added up our ages so it a grenaded them so typically let's just
get rid of the other marks typically you
would use this so we'll delete two males
and let's rerun this again and it should make more sense did I get in here oh we
didn't get rid of the yeah just get rid of to two ages as well run that again
and here we go so now the ages are there so 60 Jill is 60 you see it here it
lines up so the difference between identity and count is very important one
more thing here we want to also know which one's male and which ones female
that would be kind of fun to have let's see if we can add anything to that so we
have a geometry of stat equals identity comma AES fill equals and we're gonna
put the fill as our gender let's see what happens there
and these are fun to play around with so you can tell that the female is the red

00:06
and the male is the green and it did exactly what we were saying lots of
different options on here you have to also learn how to use the help features
within our itself by doing question mark you can type in things like G on
went or G on bar and you can read the help down here if that doesn't quite do
it for you when you go to you stack over or something in google you google it
you're gonna see things that are similar and just getting used to the syntax is
really what matters because you know this could have easily have been let's
let's see what happens if we put this in our actual geometry plot up here as an
aesthetic and we say fill equals gender rerun that and run it and it does the
same thing so when you see things that are slightly different don't be afraid
to try them out as all I'm saying but yeah now we have a colorful pretty chart

00:07
and that's the basics of bar charts so when you use identity you're actually
using the y-axis as some sort of value in your data in this case our age and
when we're using stat we're doing a count of how many occurrences for
example let's do one more example and let's let's go and say let's make this
60 into a 23 so we should have if we do the stat equals count again but with the
count remember we can't have in a y-axis because we're just doing a count of
occurrences and we're not doing people we're doing age now let's keep the fill
as gender there and just see what happens so we hit enter gender not found
let's see there we go something just wasn't loaded
and now we run this again and we do have the gender works now of course this

00:08
doesn't make too much sense because we have our ages as a continuous variable
when we know it's discrete so what we could do is what we have to do is we can
say factor age and do it this way because remember it all depends on what
you're doing but if we do it as factor it actually stacks them up like that
again factors are like categories instead of saying hey we have a
continuous amount of ages which we really we do but not in this data you
know we have a very specific age 23 doesn't matter if you 23 and a half or
23.2 so remember that if you run into that problem where this is gone and it
like this you know you're looking at a continuous spectrum between zero and
whatever that highest number is you probably want this to be a factor or a
category I want to know how categorically how many people are age 23
that's male and how many that are female and that's what this chart shows you

00:09
simple and there are so many things you can do with ggplot I just wanted to give
you a very quick explanation of how bar charts work so there you go let's move
on to the next lessonEnd of file

remember the c is like reminds me of column so if i have a column of people
the header is called people and the people that are in that column is
whatever we want them to be let's do Dave Jackie

00:01
mark and then we'll do for an example we're gonna repeat a couple of these
let's do mark mark a couple times and let's add a another one Jill okay so we
have some people here now this data frame only consists of one column at the

here I'm gonna hit enter just to get some white space in there I want to add
their ages so we'll do the same thing we'll use a column let's put that C

or the view it goes downward so let's let's keep that in mind ok now we're
ready to create some bar plots let me show you the basic way to do it we're
gonna create our base plot we're gonna call that our I don't know DF base we're
going to assign this to DF base a GG plot remember and then we add the data
equals data is equal to our data frame that we just created above that comma
our aesthetic let's say we want to plot our x equals let's just go ahead and say

00:03
people across the x-axis and let's let's hit command enter on that you'll see
there's no error but it also doesn't plot anything even if I did DF base here
and I hit command enter it plots remember it just set up our plots but it
didn't actually plot anything because there's no us there's no geometry to
this so let's go ahead and add a geometry let's do a DF base and we're
going to add a geometry geometry gonna do G on bar now inside of this bar there
is a parameter you have to set and that is the statistic we want a statistic to
be equal to something if we put in the statistic to equal count let's let's see
what happens so we are gonna we are going to plot
this right now in real time on line 9 by hitting command enter and what you see
here on the bottom is you see our names Dave Jacky Jill and mark but you see
mark has a count of 3 on the top left here as you can see I am in there 3

00:04
times so that makes perfect sense but what if we wanted to plot instead of the
occurrences of my name but we wanted to plot some of the values like let's plot
our ages that correspond with our names which is a little bit different here so
instead of our x equals people which it will we're also going to
add an aesthetic 4y is equal to age and let's see what we get here so we're
going to do command enter to refresh our DF base and when add to that base our
geometry now let's see what happens here
we probably will get an error so it says down here that the stat count must not
be used with a Y aesthetic so we can't do a count here but what we do is we put
in identity and once we do that we hit enter we have our identity it just means
hey use this age as the value on our y-axis so we have our ages across the
y-axis however as you can tell here since my name was repeated three times

00:05
it actually added up our ages so it a grenaded them so typically let's just
get rid of the other marks typically you
would use this so we'll delete two males
and let's rerun this again and it should make more sense did I get in here oh we
didn't get rid of the yeah just get rid of to two ages as well run that again
and here we go so now the ages are there so 60 Jill is 60 you see it here it
lines up so the difference between identity and count is very important one
more thing here we want to also know which one's male and which ones female
that would be kind of fun to have let's see if we can add anything to that so we
have a geometry of stat equals identity comma AES fill equals and we're gonna
put the fill as our gender let's see what happens there
and these are fun to play around with so you can tell that the female is the red

00:06
and the male is the green and it did exactly what we were saying lots of
different options on here you have to also learn how to use the help features
within our itself by doing question mark you can type in things like G on
went or G on bar and you can read the help down here if that doesn't quite do
it for you when you go to you stack over or something in google you google it
you're gonna see things that are similar and just getting used to the syntax is
really what matters because you know this could have easily have been let's
let's see what happens if we put this in our actual geometry plot up here as an
aesthetic and we say fill equals gender rerun that and run it and it does the
same thing so when you see things that are slightly different don't be afraid
to try them out as all I'm saying but yeah now we have a colorful pretty chart

00:07
and that's the basics of bar charts so when you use identity you're actually
using the y-axis as some sort of value in your data in this case our age and
when we're using stat we're doing a count of how many occurrences for
example let's do one more example and let's let's go and say let's make this
60 into a 23 so we should have if we do the stat equals count again but with the
count remember we can't have in a y-axis because we're just doing a count of
occurrences and we're not doing people we're doing age now let's keep the fill
as gender there and just see what happens so we hit enter gender not found
let's see there we go something just wasn't loaded
and now we run this again and we do have the gender works now of course this

00:08
doesn't make too much sense because we have our ages as a continuous variable
when we know it's discrete so what we could do is what we have to do is we can
say factor age and do it this way because remember it all depends on what
you're doing but if we do it as factor it actually stacks them up like that
again factors are like categories instead of saying hey we have a
continuous amount of ages which we really we do but not in this data you
know we have a very specific age 23 doesn't matter if you 23 and a half or
23.2 so remember that if you run into that problem where this is gone and it
like this you know you're looking at a continuous spectrum between zero and
whatever that highest number is you probably want this to be a factor or a
category I want to know how categorically how many people are age 23
that's male and how many that are female and that's what this chart shows you

00:09
simple and there are so many things you can do with ggplot I just wanted to give
you a very quick explanation of how bar charts work so there you go let's move

previously we played around with some G on point or scatterplots
today I'm gonna show you how to create some bar plots and so follow along add
library ggplot and we're going to create our own data frame as well which we
haven't had a lot of practice with so we
can create a data frame we will assign a data frame structure so to get that
structure we include data frame as a function the function data frame will
return a data frame structure so a data frame we're going to input random data
so I'm going to put people and we're going to set people equal to and
remember the c is like reminds me of column so if i have a column of people
the header is called people and the people that are in that column is
whatever we want them to be let's do Dave Jackie

00:01
mark and then we'll do for an example we're gonna repeat a couple of these
let's do mark mark a couple times and let's add a another one Jill okay so we
have some people here now this data frame only consists of one column at the
moment so let's create another column let's add something by hitting a comma
here I'm gonna hit enter just to get some white space in there I want to add
their ages so we'll do the same thing we'll use a column let's put that C
there and let's put in ages twenty three
twenty five I'm just making these up and I think there should be at least six of
them right and they don't have to be in any order something like that so there
are some ages for us and let's add one more and put gender in there so a column
that says gender we're gonna do male female male male

00:02
male and finally female let's hit command to enter on that and make sure
your data frame your DF the object returned is a data frame you can see it
over here and in our environment click on DF you can see what I'm talking about
the columns of people columns of Ages and gender and they're all lined up it's
a little confusing sometimes because you're kind of looking at it
horizontally here and then when it actually displays in the GUI interface
or the view it goes downward so let's let's keep that in mind ok now we're
ready to create some bar plots let me show you the basic way to do it we're
gonna create our base plot we're gonna call that our I don't know DF base we're
going to assign this to DF base a GG plot remember and then we add the data
equals data is equal to our data frame that we just created above that comma
our aesthetic let's say we want to plot our x equals let's just go ahead and say

00:03
people across the x-axis and let's let's hit command enter on that you'll see
there's no error but it also doesn't plot anything even if I did DF base here
and I hit command enter it plots remember it just set up our plots but it
didn't actually plot anything because there's no us there's no geometry to
this so let's go ahead and add a geometry let's do a DF base and we're
going to add a geometry geometry gonna do G on bar now inside of this bar there
is a parameter you have to set and that is the statistic we want a statistic to
be equal to something if we put in the statistic to equal count let's let's see
what happens so we are gonna we are going to plot
this right now in real time on line 9 by hitting command enter and what you see
here on the bottom is you see our names Dave Jacky Jill and mark but you see
mark has a count of 3 on the top left here as you can see I am in there 3

00:04
times so that makes perfect sense but what if we wanted to plot instead of the
occurrences of my name but we wanted to plot some of the values like let's plot
our ages that correspond with our names which is a little bit different here so
instead of our x equals people which it will we're also going to
add an aesthetic 4y is equal to age and let's see what we get here so we're
going to do command enter to refresh our DF base and when add to that base our
geometry now let's see what happens here
we probably will get an error so it says down here that the stat count must not
be used with a Y aesthetic so we can't do a count here but what we do is we put
in identity and once we do that we hit enter we have our identity it just means
hey use this age as the value on our y-axis so we have our ages across the
y-axis however as you can tell here since my name was repeated three times

00:05
it actually added up our ages so it a grenaded them so typically let's just

can create a data frame we will assign a data frame structure so to get that
structure we include data frame as a function the function data frame will
return a data frame structure so a data frame we're going to input random data
so I'm going to put people and we're going to set people equal to and
remember the c is like reminds me of column so if i have a column of people
the header is called people and the people that are in that column is
whatever we want them to be let's do Dave Jackie

00:01
mark and then we'll do for an example we're gonna repeat a couple of these
let's do mark mark a couple times and let's add a another one Jill okay so we
have some people here now this data frame only consists of one column at the
moment so let's create another column let's add something by hitting a comma
here I'm gonna hit enter just to get some white space in there I want to add
their ages so we'll do the same thing we'll use a column let's put that C
there and let's put in ages twenty three
twenty five I'm just making these up and I think there should be at least six of
them right and they don't have to be in any order something like that so there
are some ages for us and let's add one more and put gender in there so a column
that says gender we're gonna do male female male male

00:02
male and finally female let's hit command to enter on that and make sure
your data frame your DF the object returned is a data frame you can see it
over here and in our environment click on DF you can see what I'm talking about
the columns of people columns of Ages and gender and they're all lined up it's
a little confusing sometimes because you're kind of looking at it
horizontally here and then when it actually displays in the GUI interface
or the view it goes downward so let's let's keep that in mind ok now we're
ready to create some bar plots let me show you the basic way to do it we're
gonna create our base plot we're gonna call that our I don't know DF base we're
going to assign this to DF base a GG plot remember and then we add the data
equals data is equal to our data frame that we just created above that comma
our aesthetic let's say we want to plot our x equals let's just go ahead and say

00:03
people across the x-axis and let's let's hit command enter on that you'll see
there's no error but it also doesn't plot anything even if I did DF base here
and I hit command enter it plots remember it just set up our plots but it
didn't actually plot anything because there's no us there's no geometry to
this so let's go ahead and add a geometry let's do a DF base and we're
going to add a geometry geometry gonna do G on bar now inside of this bar there
is a parameter you have to set and that is the statistic we want a statistic to
be equal to something if we put in the statistic to equal count let's let's see
what happens so we are gonna we are going to plot
this right now in real time on line 9 by hitting command enter and what you see
here on the bottom is you see our names Dave Jacky Jill and mark but you see
mark has a count of 3 on the top left here as you can see I am in there 3

00:04
times so that makes perfect sense but what if we wanted to plot instead of the
occurrences of my name but we wanted to plot some of the values like let's plot
our ages that correspond with our names which is a little bit different here so
instead of our x equals people which it will we're also going to
add an aesthetic 4y is equal to age and let's see what we get here so we're
going to do command enter to refresh our DF base and when add to that base our
geometry now let's see what happens here
we probably will get an error so it says down here that the stat count must not
be used with a Y aesthetic so we can't do a count here but what we do is we put
in identity and once we do that we hit enter we have our identity it just means
hey use this age as the value on our y-axis so we have our ages across the
y-axis however as you can tell here since my name was repeated three times

00:05
it actually added up our ages so it a grenaded them so typically let's just
get rid of the other marks typically you
would use this so we'll delete two males
and let's rerun this again and it should make more sense did I get in here oh we
didn't get rid of the yeah just get rid of to two ages as well run that again
and here we go so now the ages are there so 60 Jill is 60 you see it here it
lines up so the difference between identity and count is very important one
more thing here we want to also know which one's male and which ones female
that would be kind of fun to have let's see if we can add anything to that so we
have a geometry of stat equals identity comma AES fill equals and we're gonna
put the fill as our gender let's see what happens there
and these are fun to play around with so you can tell that the female is the red

00:06
and the male is the green and it did exactly what we were saying lots of
different options on here you have to also learn how to use the help features
within our itself by doing question mark you can type in things like G on
went or G on bar and you can read the help down here if that doesn't quite do
it for you when you go to you stack over or something in google you google it
you're gonna see things that are similar and just getting used to the syntax is
really what matters because you know this could have easily have been let's
let's see what happens if we put this in our actual geometry plot up here as an
aesthetic and we say fill equals gender rerun that and run it and it does the
same thing so when you see things that are slightly different don't be afraid
to try them out as all I'm saying but yeah now we have a colorful pretty chart

00:07
and that's the basics of bar charts so when you use identity you're actually
using the y-axis as some sort of value in your data in this case our age and
when we're using stat we're doing a count of how many occurrences for
example let's do one more example and let's let's go and say let's make this
60 into a 23 so we should have if we do the stat equals count again but with the
count remember we can't have in a y-axis because we're just doing a count of
occurrences and we're not doing people we're doing age now let's keep the fill
as gender there and just see what happens so we hit enter gender not found
let's see there we go something just wasn't loaded
and now we run this again and we do have the gender works now of course this

00:08
doesn't make too much sense because we have our ages as a continuous variable
when we know it's discrete so what we could do is what we have to do is we can
say factor age and do it this way because remember it all depends on what
you're doing but if we do it as factor it actually stacks them up like that
again factors are like categories instead of saying hey we have a
continuous amount of ages which we really we do but not in this data you
know we have a very specific age 23 doesn't matter if you 23 and a half or
23.2 so remember that if you run into that problem where this is gone and it
like this you know you're looking at a continuous spectrum between zero and
whatever that highest number is you probably want this to be a factor or a
category I want to know how categorically how many people are age 23
that's male and how many that are female and that's what this chart shows you

00:09
simple and there are so many things you can do with ggplot I just wanted to give
you a very quick explanation of how bar charts work so there you go let's move
on to the next lessonEnd of file
